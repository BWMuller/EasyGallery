# EasyGallery
Android gallery query tools to making creating a custom gallery easier.
The idea behind this library is to allow developers to create their own UI for a gallery 
without having to figure out how to effectively read the device media and query it quickly. 

## Download
Gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'za.co.bwmuller:easygallery-core:0.0.1'
}
```

## How do I Use?
#### Permission
The library requires two permissions:
- `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- `android.permission.INTERNET`

So if you are targeting Android 6.0+, you need to handle runtime permission request before next step.

### Implementation
Please look at the ui in the easyGallery. It contains a simple implementation of the core reader
The easy permissions module can also be used. It contains some simple code that makes requesting permissions from
anywhere simpler.

## Thanks
This library is inspired by [Matisse](https://github.com/zhihu/Matisse) and uses some of its source code.
